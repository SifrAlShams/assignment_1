0,Why are some people against renewable energy? ,"I’m genuinely curious and not trying to shame anyone or be partisan. I always understood renewable energy to be a part of the solution, (if not for climate change, then certainly for energy security). Why then are many people so resistant to this change and even enthusiastic about oil and gas? 

Edit:

Thanks for the answers everyone. It sounds like a mix of politics, cost, and the technology being imperfect. My follow up question is what is the plan to secure energy in the future, if not renewable energy? I would think that continuing to develop technologies would be in everyone's best interest. Is the plan to drill for oil until we run out in 50-100 years? ",greenpowerranger,2025-01-02 03:04:45,433,NoStupidQuestions

6,Why isn’t renewable energy being largely adopted in the U.S now?,"Despite technological advances and falling cost of renewables, there is still slow adoption globally, and particularly in the U.S compared to other developed countries. For the sake of simplicity, I am disregarding which energy production method is best for the environment, and focusing just on the monetary benefits / drawbacks of different production methods. Renewables (wind, solar) are now the cheapest form of energy production by levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Given this, and the high level of sentiment politicians in the U.S are putting on reducing energy cost, and increasing energy independence, do you think we should be accelerating the transition to renewable energy?

7,Paths to take for somebody interested in renewable energy,"Context. Incoming college freshman at a top ranked university but most importantly i got a full ride. Im really aiming to make it in the renewable energy sector. I love the environment and traveling and has really set my mind in making the future more sustainable. Problem is there is “renewable energy” major in college. I’m debating between majoring in electrical vs environmental engineering. Which path would give me the right tools and knowledge to actively work on a solution to the problem? I know EE is probably a better major in terms of post grad salary and job placement but i’m okay with losing some of that if it means later down the line i can work on what I love. Also, would post grad education be a good option? I can get a masters at the same university in one year for relatively cheap but people have been saying masters degrees aren’t as valuable as you think. It’s a lot of ifs and frankly a lot of this is being asked earlier than needed but i’m at the point where im trying to find what to do for the next 40 years of my life.",PhonicsOW,2024-03-25 10:51:44,0,ElectricalEngineering
